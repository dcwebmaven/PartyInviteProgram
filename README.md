# PartyInviteProgram
This PHP program uses a form to send invitations to up to 10 people for an upcoming event.

Here are the specs for the project:

Create a PHP form that takes up to 10 names and email addresses, and a PHP program that uses a text file as a template to send out personalized party invitations to each email address. The text file template should be altered in each case to include the invitee's name. The PHP program should then confirm the party list by listing all valid email addresses to which the invitation was sent.  No form validation is wanted, meaning no action is needed for an invalid email address.
